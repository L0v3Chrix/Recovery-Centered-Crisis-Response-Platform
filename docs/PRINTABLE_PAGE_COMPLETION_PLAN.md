  showAllCategories: boolean
  resourceCount: number
}
```

### Key Functions to Implement

2. `handleSelectAll()`
3. `handleDeselectAll()`
4. `getFilteredResources()`
5. `getSelectedCategoriesCount()`
6. `updatePrintButtonText()`

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have (Definition of Done)
- [ ] **515+ resources** are implemented and verified
- [ ] **Category selection UI** with checkboxes for each category
- [ ] **"Select All" option** that selects/deselects all categories
- [ ] **Print functionality** respects category selection
- [ ] **Resource count display** shows total and selected counts
- [ ] **Print-optimized** layout maintains readability
- [ ] **Responsive design** works on all device sizes

### Quality Standards
- [ ] No duplicate resources across categories
- [ ] All contact information complete and accurate
- [ ] Proper print page breaks and formatting
- [ ] Category selection UI hidden during printing
- [ ] Print button text updates dynamically ("Print All" vs "Print Selected")

## Testing Checklist

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Select individual categories and verify correct resources print
- [ ] Select "All" and verify all 515+ resources print
- [ ] Deselect all and verify print button shows appropriate message
- [ ] Test various category combinations
- [ ] Verify resource count accuracy in each category

### Print Testing
- [ ] Test print preview shows only selected categories
- [ ] Verify page breaks work correctly
- [ ] Check print header/footer displays properly
- [ ] Test print scaling and margins
- [ ] Verify important phone numbers section prints

### Browser/Device Testing
- [ ] Chrome desktop print functionality
- [ ] Firefox desktop print functionality
- [ ] Safari desktop print functionality
- [ ] Mobile browser print functionality
- [ ] Tablet browser print functionality

## Success Metrics
- **Primary**: 515+ resources successfully implemented and printable
- **Secondary**: Category selection works for all possible combinations
- **Tertiary**: Print output is clean, readable, and professionally formatted

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: Resource data too large for single page load
- **Mitigation**: Implement lazy loading or pagination if needed

- **Risk**: Print formatting breaks with large datasets
- **Mitigation**: Test with full dataset early, optimize CSS for print

- **Risk**: Category selection UI becomes cluttered
- **Mitigation**: Use collapsible sections or dropdown interface

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Resource Integration (2-3 hours)
- **Phase 2**: Category Selection (1-2 hours) 
- **Phase 3**: UI/UX (1 hour)
- **Phase 4**: Testing (1 hour)
- **Phase 5**: QA (30 minutes)

**Total Estimated Time**: 5.5-7.5 hours

## Final Deliverable
A complete printable resource page with:
- All 515+ resources from extracted documentation
- Intuitive category selection interface
- Professional print formatting
- Verified accuracy and functionality
